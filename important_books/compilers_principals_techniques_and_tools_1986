Chapter 1: Introduction to Compiling
- defn: compiler: a program that reads a program written in one (source)
        language and translates it into an equivalent program in another
        (target) language
- Compiliation modeled as analysis && synthesis
  analysis: break the source program into constituent pieces and and create
  an intermediate representation of the program, often produces a tree
  synthesis: construct the desired target program from the intermediate
  synthesis requires the more complex techniques
